# GAMESHELF

## One Sentence Pitch:
Discover, track, and share your gaming journey with a community of passionate gamers.


## Core Functionality:
 A platform where users can browse games and catalog their game collections, rate and review games, and create custom lists (e.g., “Favorites,” “Wishlist,” “Currently Playing”).


This project will be built with the PERN stack.

User will be able to browse games and upon login can search through games, adding them to their lists of favorites, write and view game reviews, view their “shelf” of games pulled from their lists, and change their basic profile information.
